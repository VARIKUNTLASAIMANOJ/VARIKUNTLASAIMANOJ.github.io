        <p>Iris Versicolor</p>
        <p>Iris versicolor is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant, growing 10–80 cm (4–31 in) high. It tends to form large clumps from thick, 
            creeping rhizomes. The unwinged, erect stems generally have basal leaves that are more than 1 cm (1⁄2 in) wide. Leaves are folded on 
            the midribs so that they form an overlapping flat fan. The well developed blue flower has 6 petals and sepals spread out nearly flat 
            and have two forms. The longer sepals are hairless and have a greenish-yellow blotch at their base. The inferior ovary is bluntly 
            angled. Flowers are usually light to deep blue (purple and violet are not uncommon) and bloom during May to July. Fruit is a 3-celled,
             bluntly angled capsule. The large seeds can be observed floating in fall.</p>

        <p>Iris Virginica</p>
        <p>Iris virginica is a perennial plant that grows up to 0.6–0.9 m (2–3 ft) tall. The plant's sword-shaped basal leaves are erect or 
            sometimes arching and measure up to 91 cm (3 ft) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) across at the base. The leaves have smooth margins and are 
            bluish green to green and glabrous. Unbranched or sparingly branched flowering stalks rise from the basal leaves to a height of up to 
            0.6–0.9 m (2–3 ft). Small, alternate leaves are located on the stalks, with 1 to 2 flowers emerging from the axil of each of these 
            leaves on pedicels that are 3–13 cm (1–5 in) long.

            The flowers, which bloom May to July, are blue to blue-violet and are a typical iris shape. Each flower has 3 drooping sepals, called 
            "falls", that have white marks and yellow near the throat, and 3 upright petals, called "standards". Flowers measure 3–13 cm (1–5 in) 
            across.</p>

        <p>Iris Setosa</p>
        <p>Iris setosa is similar in form to a miniature Japanese iris, or a dwarf version of Iris sibirica but a shorter lived version. 
            
            The shallowly rooted, large, branching rhizomes spread over time to create large clumps. he rhizomes are grey-brown, thick, and are 
            covered with old (maroon-brown) fibrous leaf remains (of last seasons leaves). 

            It has branched stems, which are very variable in height, ranging from 10 cm (5 inches) up to 1 m (3 ft) tall. The larger 
            plants can grow beyond the height of the leaves.  The roundish stems are between 1.5–9 cm in diameter with 1 to 3 branches.

            Iris setosa has mid-green leaves, which are grass-like, and lanceolate (sword-shaped). They have a purplish tinged base and the 
            leaves can measure 30–60 cm (12–24 in) long by 0.8–2.5 cm wide.
